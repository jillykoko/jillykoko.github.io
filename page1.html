		<p> Caprice likes <strong>Avatar</strong> because it reminds her of the childhood she never had.<br> <em>Caprice's ability to empathize with animated characters is incredible.</em> </br> Caprice plans on shaving her head and getting a blue arrow tattooed as soon as possible, <br> probably after college because she still needs her parents to pay her tuition</br> <p>

		<p> Top Avatar episodes according to Caprice: </p>
